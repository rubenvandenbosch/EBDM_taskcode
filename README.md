# Effort-based decision-making task

## Description
Experiment task code in Matlab to test effort-based decision making.   

The task is based on the apple-gathering task from: Le Heron, C., Manohar, S., Plant, O., Muhammed, K., Griffanti, L., Nemeth, A., Douaud, G., Markus, H. S., & Husain, M. (2018). Dysfunctional effort-based decision-making underlies apathy in genetic cerebral small vessel disease. Brain, 141(11), 3193â€“3210. https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awy257  

The code is adapted from the Squeezy script written by Sanjay Manohar (https://github.com/sgmanohar/matlib), using his Matlib toolbox (https://osf.io/vmabg/).  
Modifications include the use of a TSG manufactured gripforce device (making use of fieldtrip toolbox) and the option to run the decision trials in the MRI scanner.

The experiment is divided in three stages: 
- practice  : calibration of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), familiarization with effort-levels, practice decisions
- choice 	: main experiment phase (MRI optional) of effort-based decision-making
